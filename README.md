Free Internet to sidestep net-neutrality sanctions.

It's kinda silly to say we need wired infrastructure for internet. While servers and the like need bandwidth that is not supported by wifi signals and such, the average home has more than enough capability for connecting and streaming to and from the internet. So I propose:
  1.)We create an easy way for anyone to turn personal wireless routers into internet antennas as well as access points.
  2.)This infrastructure will be used to sidestep any potential restrictions that may be sanctioned.
  3.)We do so anonymously.
  4.)We make it free for everyone.
  5.)The project must have an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) by the 14th of December!
